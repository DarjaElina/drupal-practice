## Drupal Playground 🍁

This repository is a study playground for Drupal 10.
It is used as part of the Content Management Systems (CMS) course at Helsinki Business College.

Here I work on course assignments and practice things like:

- Creating and improving custom themes

- Writing and experimenting with Twig templates

- Building simple modules

- Exploring Drupal theming and site structure
